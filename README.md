Vent-It

Description

Ever get into a heated text arguement and said stuff out of anger and freely because it was text and not face to face? Sometimes it feels good/theraputic to say what you're feeling or thinking, but freely saying what you want can cause other real life problems and regrets.  This is where Vent-It comes to your rescue.

Vent-It is a simple tool for personal use as a gateway to vent one's frsutrations stress, and thoughts in the heat of the moment.  A message style application where user can create various categories of topics and then can write out messages, text, or letters. But those messages are personal and stay in the application to dwell as you calm down.  It feels good to write it out and get it off your chest.  And when the user feels calmer, at peacea, they get to Burn it. This is intended for self-help, anger management and theraputic purposes for the user.

Future Goals:

    Part of the theraputic process is writing a note but then setting it a flame.  I want to devlope animations with React that will display sometype of burning effect of the text field when user clicks the burn button.
